# Introduction

If you are a developer, then you know about the value of time. Optimization of working process - one of the most important aspects of IT.

Either way, our work requires repetition of the same actions: quick screenshots and uploading them to server, processing selected text, converting files, parsing data and so on. And here bash comes to help us.

**Bash** is a Unix shell written by [Brian Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)) for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell). It was released in 1989 and has been distributed as default shell in Linux and OS X.

So why should we start to learn something written about 30 years ago? The answer is quite simple: this _something_ still stay one of the most powerful tools for writing efficient scripts on all Unix-based systems. That's why you should learn bash.

In this handbook, I'm going to describe the most important concepts in bash with examples. I'm sure this compendium will be helpful for you.
